# Pathfinder

Find all the shortest paths between every point pair there is.

Provide the list of bridges between cities and the length of the bridge, and get the best possible routes, all of them.

This is one of the examples how the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used.

### Input Example
First line should contain the number of islands.
Next lines should be in format [a-b,n] where a and b are alphabetical point names and b is the bridge length between the points.
